    # 'host' network mode is crucial here because:
    # 1. The script constructs URLs using 'localhost' and the mapped host port.
    # 2. Inside the container, 'localhost' typically refers to the container itself,
    #    unless we share the host's networking stack.
    # Note: This works best on Linux. On Docker Desktop (Mac/Windows), this has limitations.
